            <p><strong>Importance and background of GOLDEN FRIDAY</strong><br><br>Malankara Orthodox Church celebrating 'SUVRNA VELLIYAZCHA (GOLDEN FRIDAY) after the feat of Pentecosti.Usually we observe the Swarna Velliazhcha (Golden Friday) on the Friday followed by the feast of Pentecost. The thought of the day will be the healing given to the lame, by St. Peter. The incident is described in Acts of the Apostles 3: 1-10. When St. Peter and St. John went to the Temple for the hourly prayer, a lame from his birth was sitting at the gate of the Temple which was known as the Beautiful gate asked for alms. St. Peter fastened his eyes upon the lame and said Look on us. The lame expected to get alms from them. But St. Peter said, "I have no Silver and Gold. But I give what I have. You rise up and walk in the name of Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth." And St. Peter took him by the right hand, and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And the lame leaping up stood, and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God. After this incident every year,the Holy Church observes this Friday as Golden Friday. This must be the first miracle done by the Apostles without the physical presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. We find a high level faith in the giver and the recipient. The lame, when he got healing, went into the Temple to praise God for the mercy.</p><p>Bible Reading : Acts 3 1-10</p><p>1.One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon. 2 Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. 3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. 4 Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!” 5 So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.</p><p>6 Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” 7 Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. 8 He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. 9 When all the people saw him walking and praising God, 10 they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>
